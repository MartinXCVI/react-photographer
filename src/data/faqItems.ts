    question: "How far in advance should I book a session?",
    answer:
      "To ensure availability and the best experience possible, I recommend booking your session at least 2 to 4 weeks in advance. This is especially important during busy seasons such as spring, fall, and the holiday months when demand tends to spike. Weekend slots and golden hour timeframes are often the first to fill up, so reaching out early helps secure your ideal date and time. If you're planning something bigger like an event or wedding, even earlier notice — sometimes months ahead — is ideal.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer retouching or photo editing?",
    answer:
      "Yes, absolutely — all photos delivered include professional post-processing. This means I carefully adjust lighting, colors, sharpness, contrast, and overall tone to ensure your images look clean and vibrant while still feeling natural. If you’re looking for more advanced retouching — such as skin smoothing, object removal, or creative effects — I also offer those services as add-ons.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to receive the final photos?",
    answer:
      "For most sessions, the standard turnaround time is 5 to 7 business days. This allows me time to carefully select, edit, and curate the best images for you. For larger events, such as weddings or multi-location shoots, it may take between 1 to 2 weeks depending on the size of the project. You’ll be notified as soon as your gallery is ready!",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I choose the location for the shoot?",
    answer:
      "Definitely! In fact, I encourage you to pick a location that feels meaningful or comfortable to you — whether it's a local park, your home, a cozy urban spot, or even a scenic area outside of town. If you’re unsure, I can suggest locations based on your style — be it natural, urban, elegant, or minimalist.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you require a deposit?",
    answer:
      "Yes, a small non-refundable deposit is required at the time of booking to reserve your session. This deposit goes toward your total balance and secures your date on my calendar. The remaining amount is typically due on the day of the session. If something comes up and you need to reschedule, I’m happy to work with you to find a new time.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if it rains or the weather is bad?",
    answer:
      "If it looks like rain or extreme conditions are expected on the day of your outdoor shoot, we can either reschedule at no extra charge or move the session to an indoor location if available. I monitor the weather closely and will be in touch the day before with options. Sometimes, even a moody sky can result in beautiful images!",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you travel for shoots?",
    answer:
      "Yes! I love working in new environments and am happy to travel for sessions. Travel within a certain radius is usually included in standard pricing. For longer distances or destination shoots, additional travel fees may apply. I also offer custom packages for out-of-town events or destination weddings.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I receive my photos?",
    answer:
      "Your photos will be delivered through a secure online gallery. From there, you can view, download, and share your images in high resolution. The gallery works great on both mobile and desktop, and includes printing options if you'd like professional-quality physical copies.",
