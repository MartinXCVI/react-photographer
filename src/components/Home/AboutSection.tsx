          About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
          Photography can be both literal and poetic. On one hand, it’s a way to say, “I was here,” “This is me,” or “Be part of my world.” It’s so common now that not knowing how to take a photo feels out of place. On the other hand, it’s a tool of wonder—a box that captures light and lets you turn it into anything you imagine.

          When I raise my camera and meet my subject’s gaze, the world fades into silence. From the first click to the final edit, I feel alive. Each photo is a creation, a small evolution in my journey as an artist. That feeling—that growth—is everything to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, I hope to play a part—big or small—in the change our planet urgently needs. I hope the impact lasts decades. And I hope we don’t just remember endangered species—we still have them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, I love the thrill at the start of something new. I love strange ideas, bold flavors, the perfect playlist, and watching the wild shift with every change in light.
